# Overview
## Project Overview
Pewlett-Hackard has numerous employees that are reaching the retirement age, many of whom are in Senior or Management level roles. The amount of expected retirements will have a significant impact on business operations. In order to reduce the impact, Pewlett-Hackard is analyzing the employees reaching retirement age to better understand the following:

- Expected number of retirees
- Expected retirees per department/role
- Number of potential mentors

By understanding the nmber of expected retirees per department, the company can better prepare by training staff, hiring, and potentially rolling out a mentorship program. The mentorship program would encourage people to work part-time instead of fully retire and become a mentor for those employees that will eventually be filling the more senior/management-level roles.

## Technology Used

- PGAdmin
- CSV (for importing and exporting data)

# Results
Four key results were identified as part of the analysis. 

1. The analysis shows that a total of 90,398 employees are within the retirement age based on the criteria use (birth date between 1952-01-01 and 1955-12-31)
2. The most impacted roles were Senior Engineers (33%) and Senior Staff (31%). These two roles acccount for 64% of the employee poplation expected to be nearing retirement. See **Table 1** for details.
3. In addition to Senior personnel, the number of total Engineers within the retirement age is concerning. There are 29,414 Senior Engineers and 14,222 Engineers within the retirement range. While the greatest number is Senior Engineers, the company will need to ensure it has enough Engineers overall to continue business operations.
4. There are primarily Senior Staff eligible for the mentorship program, followed by Engineers and Senior Engineers. Given the number of Senior Staff and Senior Engineers expected to retire, it will be important that these employees are engaged in the mentorship program to help train replacements for the retirees.
