# Overview
## Project Overview
Pewlett-Hackard has numerous employees that are reaching the retirement age, many of whom are in Senior or Management level roles. The amount of expected retirements will have a significant impact on business operations. In order to reduce the impact, Pewlett-Hackard is analyzing the employees reaching retirement age to better understand the following:

- Expected number of retirees
- Expected retirees per department/role
- Number of potential mentors

By understanding the nmber of expected retirees per department, the company can better prepare by training staff, hiring, and potentially rolling out a mentorship program. The mentorship program would encourage people to work part-time instead of fully retire and become a mentor for those employees that will eventually be filling the more senior/management-level roles.
